"""Stage 2b: turn a book into an annotated audiobook script.

The LLM is an ANALYTICAL CLASSIFIER here, never a generator of book text.
Code tokenizes each chunk into spans (span_tokenizer), sends the LLM span ids
plus their text, and receives back ONLY labels, keyed by span id --
``{"<id>": {"speaker", "role", "instruct"}}``. Code then reassembles the script
verbatim from the source string by span offsets. Consequences:

* Truncated or malformed LLM output costs LABELS, never PROSE. Any span the
  LLM did not label falls back to NARRATOR with its text intact.
* A chunk's entries always concatenate byte-for-byte back to the chunk. That
  is asserted in code (`_assert_chunk_verbatim`) -- a failure is a bug, not a
  warning.
* Degradation is never silent: it is counted, summarised, and surfaced as
  exit code 3 (see the exit site in main()).
* A misspelled schema KEY is recovered (_recover_label_keys), a misspelled
  speaker NAME is not (that is speaker_canon's job, under much tighter rules).
  Keys come from this module's own four-word vocabulary; names come from the
  book, where two near-identical spellings are routinely two people. "text" is
  never a recovery target, so key recovery can never admit model prose.

    Verified empirically against the configured server, not inferred from
    upstream source, because Ollama vendors its own llama.cpp and the two drift.

    The response is an OBJECT keyed "1".."N" (the positional ids
    build_span_payload sends), every key required, no others allowed.
    llama.cpp's converter emits required properties unconditionally, in
    declaration order, so the exact id SET is pinned: a missing, duplicated or
    phantom id cannot be emitted. Verified on Ollama 0.40.1 -- told to repeat
    ids 1 and 2 and skip 3, it was forced to emit "1", "2", "3" once each.
    An ARRAY cannot do this: ``uniqueItems`` is unsupported and ``prefixItems``
    is accepted and SILENTLY IGNORED (llama.cpp grammars/README.md), so an
    array schema bounded only by count and range still let 12 of 281 chunks
    duplicate an id on a measured run.

    Also removed, each tied to an observed live failure:

      * ``additionalProperties: False`` on each label -- a ``text`` key cannot
        be emitted. Contract 1 becomes a decoder guarantee, not a request.
      * ``role`` as a two-value enum -- invented roles ("thought") cannot occur.
      * ``instruct`` with ``maxLength`` -- the one field that can run away, and
        what pushed a live completion into max_tokens.

    DELIBERATELY NOT CONSTRAINED, and why:

    ``speaker`` is a free string. An enum of names present in the text would
    eliminate misspellings and ~56% of retries, but when the true speaker is
    not among them the grammar forces a confidently WRONG name that
    attestation can no longer catch -- trading a loud failure for a silent one,
    against contract 7. That is a separate, measured change.

    dialogue+tag pairs (5.4%) named a different established character than the
    tag did, all of them attested and none of them detected.

    degradation report if the retry does not resolve it (resolve_span_labels).
    Relabelling the span from the tag would be a second repair_speaker --
    nearby evidence silently overruling the model -- which is the failure this
    pipeline keeps trying to eliminate, not add.

    BOUNDS, chosen for PRECISION over recall (a false accusation costs a wasted
    retry and a false exit-3, which is what erodes trust in exit 3):

      * the labelled span must be a QUOTED span ending on a closing quote mark,

        is the paragraph break, and a tag on the far side of one introduces the
        NEXT quotation instead of closing this one;
      * speaker_canon.contradicts_attribution supplies the rest: no possessive
        tag, no uncapitalized/common-noun tag, no ambiguous name, and
        granularity/case/apostrophe variants are agreement, not conflict.

    Bound (4) is not perfect: an attributive-looking tag can be a verb with an
    object ("Kit said the last couple of words of the spell") and is then a
    false hit. Hand-checking a random 25 of the 64 hits on the artifact above
    found exactly one such case -- 24/25 genuine.

    ``roster`` is an optional roster index (see speaker_canon.remember_in_roster)
    of speaker names already established EARLIER in this book. When given, an
    accepted speaker whose roster key matches an established name is normalized

    evidence that the name appears nowhere near its own lines -- is refused.

    A refused speaker becomes NARRATOR, exactly like every other rejection
    here: prose is preserved verbatim and only the voice is lost. Because that
    trade is real (narrating a genuine line is itself a loss), the gate is
    designed to be paired with the retry nudge in process_chunk, which names
    the offending label and asks the model to copy the spelling from the text
    it was shown. Rejection is the fallback; re-asking is the fix.

    BOUNDED REPAIR (``source_words``). Before refusing, a refuted label is
    offered to speaker_canon.repair_speaker(), which folds it onto an already-
    established spelling when -- and only when -- the whole book never uses the
    label's spelling and exactly one roster name sits one edit away in the
    label's own window. Repairs are reported in ``speakers_repaired`` and
    itemized in ``repairs`` as (original, repaired) pairs; process_chunk prints
    and logs each one, because rewriting a name the model did not emit must not
    be silent (contract 7). ``source_words`` is speaker_canon.source_word_index()
    over the whole book; without it repair is unavailable and the gate behaves
    exactly as it did before.

    A repair is VETOED by the attribution tag next to the same line whenever
    that tag names a different established character (see _gate_speaker): the
    label is then refused like any other unattested one -- NARRATOR, counted in
    ``unattested_rejected``, itemized in ``refused_repairs`` and degrading the
    chunk. This veto does not depend on ``check_tags``: it withholds one of THIS
    pipeline's rewrites rather than judging the model's label, and its fallback
    is the behaviour the gate already promises.

    MEASURED on one 281-chunk production run replayed from its own logged
    responses: 89 repairs, 26 of them next to a machine-readable attribution
    tag, and all 26 tags AGREED with the repaired name -- so the veto refused 0
    and that run's output is unchanged. The remaining 63 sat next to a pronoun
    tag ("he said"), an action beat or nothing at all: no adjacent evidence
    exists, nothing here can adjudicate them, and they are deliberately left
    alone rather than guessed at. The veto is therefore cheap insurance against
    a failure class, not a fix for a measured error rate; what makes the
    unadjudicable majority visible is the repair block in the run summary.

    ATTRIBUTION-TAG CHECK (``check_tags``, off by default). After every speaker
    is decided, _tag_contradictions re-reads the result against the attribution
    tag in the span right after each quotation and counts the disagreements in
    ``tag_contradictions`` (itemized in ``contradictions``). Counted ONLY --
    the label is left exactly as the model gave it, because relabelling a span
    from adjacent evidence is repair_speaker's job description and this check
    exists to make wrong answers loud, not to invent new ones. process_chunk
    asks the model again first; what survives that lands here and degrades the
    chunk.

    That text is narration and must be narrated. But a blanket
    unquoted-implies-narrator rule is WRONG and was rejected before: books
    legitimately contain unquoted character speech -- telepathy, silent speech,

    all. Measured on one 8,083-entry artifact: of 65 character-voiced entries
    containing no quotation mark, roughly 29 were genuine unquoted speech. A
    blanket rule destroys those.

    ADJACENCY IS THE ONLY STRUCTURAL SIGNAL THAT SEPARATES THEM, and it only
    separates one of the two cases. An unquoted span pressed directly against a
    quotation the model gave the same speaker is that quotation's tag or beat;
    a STANDALONE unquoted span labelled with a character has no structural
    tell distinguishing "narration the model mislabelled" from "unquoted speech
    the author wrote". Nothing here guesses at the standalone case: it is left
    with its label, and the damage is bounded instead by _merge_same_speaker
    refusing to let it swallow an adjacent quotation.

    A whitespace-only span between the two blocks adjacency, because it is a
    paragraph break -- the same bound _closing_tag_text_by_id draws for the
    same reason. Whitespace spans already resolve to NARRATOR, so this falls
    out of the speaker comparison for free.

    MEASURED on the artifact above: 13,337 chars of narration were read in a
    character voice; this rule and the kind-aware merge together bring that to
    8,220 (-38%) and remove every entry that mixes quotation with narration

        the left-single-quote mapping did not exist at all; and
      * the em-dash and en-dash KEYS had both decayed to the same ASCII
        double-quote byte, making them duplicate dict keys -- 7 literal
        entries collapsed to 6, and the en-dash mapping shadowed the em-dash
        one, so em-dash mojibake was never repaired.

    Escapes cannot decay this way, and a test asserts the dict holds exactly
    one entry per literal.

    Each key is what a UTF-8 byte sequence looks like decoded as CP1252:
    U+2014 EM DASH is E2 80 94, and CP1252 maps 0x94 to U+201D, hence
