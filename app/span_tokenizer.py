"""Character-by-character FSM that splits book text into quoted / unquoted spans.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Audiobooks are verbatim: the spoken word must match the printed word exactly.
The downstream pipeline sends only span *ids* to an LLM and receives only
*labels* back (``{"<id>": {"speaker", "role", "instruct"}}``) -- never book text.
Code then reassembles the audiobook script verbatim from the source string by
``(start, end)`` offsets. That makes this tokenizer the correctness keystone:
if the spans do not tile the source exactly, the reassembled text is wrong.

The one invariant every caller may rely on::

    "".join(source[s.start:s.end] for s in tokenize(source)) == source

Spans are contiguous (``spans[i].end == spans[i + 1].start``), the first starts
at 0, the last ends at ``len(source)``, ids are ``1..N`` in document order, and
no span is empty. Whitespace between a quotation and its attribution tag lives
in exactly one span, so concatenation is lossless.

Sentence segmentation libraries (pysbd, spaCy) are deliberately NOT used: they
group a quotation and its attribution tag into a single sentence, which is
precisely the failure mode this module fixes.

WHAT IT DOES *NOT* DO
---------------------
* It does not drop attribution tags. ``"Go," he said.`` yields a quoted span
  ``"Go,"`` and an unquoted span ``` he said.``` -- the narrator reads the tag.
* It does not classify speakers, does not detect em-dash or unquoted dialogue,
  and does not split narration into sentences. Those are the LLM's job.
* It does not normalize, strip or rewrite a single character of the source.

STATE MACHINE
-------------
Three states: ``NARRATION``, ``IN_PAIRED``, ``IN_SINGLE``. Only the *outer*
quote level delimits, so nested quotes stay inside their enclosing span
(``"She told me 'go away' yesterday," he said.`` is ONE quoted span plus one
unquoted span). A quotation left open at end of input becomes a quoted span
running to ``len(source)`` -- no crash, no lost text.

PAIRED (UNAMBIGUOUS) QUOTE DELIMITERS
-------------------------------------
``PAIRED_QUOTES`` maps every unambiguous OPENER character to the set of
characters that may close *that* opener. Adding a language's convention is a
one-line data change; the FSM never grows a branch for it. In ``IN_PAIRED``
only the closers of the opener that started the span end it, so a quotation
opened with one convention cannot be closed by another convention's mark and
inner quotes of a different convention stay inside the outer span.

Supported today:

===========  ================  =========================================
Opener       Closers           Convention
===========  ================  =========================================
``"``        ``"`` ``”``       English straight (also closes on curly)
``“``        ``"`` ``”``       English curly
``„``        ``“`` ``”``       German / Polish / Czech low-high
``«``        ``»``             French / Russian / Spanish guillemets
``‹``        ``›``             single guillemets
``「``       ``」``            CJK corner brackets
``『``       ``』``            CJK white corner brackets
``＂``       ``＂``            full-width straight (U+FF02)
===========  ================  =========================================

A ``"`` seen in NARRATION always opens -- double quotes are effectively never
apostrophes in prose. The same holds for every other character in the table:
none of them is ever an apostrophe, so none is routed through the ambiguous
single-quote machinery below, and none is subject to its length or paragraph
bounds.

``“`` IS BOTH AN OPENER AND A CLOSER -- how that is disambiguated
-----------------------------------------------------------------
``“`` opens an English curly quotation but closes a German ``„`` one. State,
not the character, decides: in NARRATION ``“`` opens (unchanged English
behaviour); inside a span opened by ``„`` it closes, because ``„``'s closer
set is the only one consulted there. An English document never contains ``„``
and so can never reach that state -- adding German cannot regress English.
The mirror case ``‚ ... ‘`` works the same way, and leaves ``‘``'s role as the
unambiguous single opener in NARRATION untouched.

Whitespace *inside* the marks is part of the quoted span and is never touched,
so French typography's inner spaces -- U+0020, U+00A0 or U+202F, as in
``« bonjour »`` -- survive byte-exactly.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT A DELIMITER
------------------------------------
``《 》`` and ``〈 〉`` mark work titles rather than speech in Chinese, and
``〝 〞`` is vanishingly rare in book text; treating them as dialogue would
quote non-dialogue, which is the unsafe direction. They stay narration.

SINGLE-QUOTE DISAMBIGUATION RULE (the ambiguous case, documented exactly)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
``'`` (U+0027) and ``’`` (right single curly) are ambiguous -- they are
also the apostrophe character. ``‘`` (left single curly) is *direction*-
unambiguous but, measured against real ebooks, is NOT guaranteed to be a
correctly paired opener (see "‘ is not exempt" below).

A single-quote character opens a quoted span only when ALL FIVE of the
following hold; otherwise it is treated as an apostrophe and stays inside the
surrounding UNQUOTED span. Rules 2-4 ask what FOLLOWS the mark in order to
tell an apostrophe from a quote, so they apply to the ambiguous glyphs only;
rules 1 and 5 apply to ``‘`` as well:

1. It is at start-of-text, or the preceding character is whitespace, or the
   preceding character is opening punctuation (one of ``([{<"“”«—–-*_~``).
   This rejects ``don't``, ``O'Brien`` and possessive ``Jones'``.
2. It is not the last character of the input.
3. The following character is an ASCII/Unicode *letter*. Requiring a letter
   (not a digit) rejects decade elisions such as ``'90s``.
4. The alphabetic run that follows is not a known elision (``'tis``, ``'twas``,
   ``'em``, ``'round``, ``'til`` ... see ``ELISIONS``). ``'tis`` therefore never
   opens a span.
5. A syntactically valid CLOSER (see below) exists later in the input, and it
   falls within BOTH of these bounds:

   a. Before the next paragraph break -- a blank-line boundary, i.e. a newline
      separated from a following newline by at most horizontal whitespace.
      When no break follows, end of input is the bound.
   b. Within ``MAX_AMBIGUOUS_SINGLE_SPAN`` characters of the opener.

   All three parts earn their keep. Without "a closer exists", an unterminated
   single quote swallows the rest of the chunk on what is far more likely an
   apostrophe. Without (a), an opener plus a possessive in a later paragraph
   closes across the paragraph boundary. Without (b), the same thing happens
   *inside* one long paragraph, which is the case that actually bites:
   ``He said 'no more.`` followed by 40 sentences of narration and ``The dogs'
   tails wagged.`` -- one paragraph, no newline anywhere -- produced a single
   1139-character *quoted* span. No text is lost either way, but handing the
   LLM a page-long quotation invites it to give plain narration a character
   voice, which is fidelity-adverse.

   ``MAX_AMBIGUOUS_SINGLE_SPAN`` is 500 to match ``MAX_CHUNK_CHARS`` in
   ``project.py``: a quotation longer than the pipeline's own chunk cap gets
   split downstream regardless, so accepting one buys nothing and risks a
   runaway. Single-quoted dialogue longer than that, or spanning a paragraph
   break, is rare enough that narrator fallback is the right trade.

``‘`` IS NOT EXEMPT (rules 1 and 5) -- superseded rationale, with evidence
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This module used to state that ``‘`` "is unambiguous and ALWAYS opens a span"
and exempted it from all five rules. Measurement disproves the premise. In a
794K-character trade ebook (281 chunks at the configured ``chunk_size`` 3000)
``‘`` opened 8 quoted spans with a median length of 906 characters and a max
of 2289; 6 exceeded 500. Against 4552 ``“`` spans of median length 33, every
one of those 8 is a false quotation: 2.58% of the book was typed ``kind=
"quoted"`` -- offered to the classifier as dialogue -- while being plain
third-person narration, with attribution tags and paragraph breaks dragged
inside one span where ``build_entries`` cannot separate them.

Two causes, both real and neither book-specific:

* **Wrong-direction smart apostrophe.** Word processors and EPUB converters
  emit ``‘`` where an apostrophe was meant (``mochteroof‘s``, ``cousins‘?``).
  6 of the book's 163 ``‘`` were preceded by a letter. Rule 1 exists exactly
  to reject ``O'Brien`` / ``Jones'`` and was simply never applied here.
  Applying it is language-neutral and needs no lexicon: a single quote
  directly after a letter is never an opening quote in any convention.
* **Leading-elision proper noun.** An elided name (``'Mela`` for Carmela) is
  whitespace-preceded, so it passes rule 1, and with no bound it ran to the
  next stray apostrophe -- 945, 977 and 844 characters in three chunks. No
  lexicon can fix this: adding the name would be corpus-fitting. Rule 5's
  bounds are the general answer, and the argument that once justified the
  exemption ("``‘`` is unambiguous") is the thing measurement falsified. What
  ``‘`` guarantees is *direction*, not correct pairing; a mark whose partner
  never arrives inside a paragraph or 500 characters is not behaving as a
  quote regardless of which glyph it is.

Rules 2-4 still do NOT apply to ``‘``: they discriminate apostrophe from
quote by the following character, a question ``‘`` does not raise, and
imposing them would narrate legitimate ``‘'Tis...’`` or ``‘1984 was...’``.

Cost to a legitimately single-quoted (British / Commonwealth) book, where
``‘ ... ’`` is the primary dialogue convention: none for ordinary dialogue,
which is whitespace- or open-punctuation-preceded and closes well inside one
paragraph. The two losses are the same ones already accepted for ``'``: a
single-quoted speech longer than ``MAX_AMBIGUOUS_SINGLE_SPAN``, and one
continued across a paragraph break without an intervening closer. Both become
narration -- no text is lost, and NARRATOR is the safe fallback.

A ``'`` or ``’`` closes an open single-quoted span only when the preceding
character is a non-space AND the following character is end-of-input,
whitespace, or any non-alphanumeric character. That keeps ``doesn't`` /
``doesn’t`` inside the quotation instead of closing it early.

Ambiguity that these rules cannot resolve resolves toward UNQUOTED, because an
unlabelled span falls back to NARRATOR downstream -- the safe failure mode.

KNOWN, ACCEPTED LIMITATIONS
---------------------------
* A single-quoted line that opens on an elision (``'Course you can,' he said.``)
  is read as narration. Rule 4 wins; narrator fallback is safe.
* A plural possessive inside single-quoted dialogue (``'the dogs' tails,' he
  said``) closes the quotation early at ``dogs'``. The remaining text becomes
  narration -- again the safe direction, and no text is lost.
* Single-quoted dialogue that continues across a paragraph break, or that runs
  longer than ``MAX_AMBIGUOUS_SINGLE_SPAN``, is read as narration (rule 5's
  two bounds). This now includes ``‘`` dialogue.
