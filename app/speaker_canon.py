"""Speaker-name canonicalization for the Alexandria audiobook pipeline.

This module is standalone and dependency-light (stdlib + rapidfuzz only).
It must NOT import anything from app.py / review_script.py / generate_script.py —
those modules will import THIS module in a later integration stage.

Two tiers:

  Tier 1 (canonicalize): fully automatic, deterministic normalization of a
  single raw speaker label into a canonical UPPERCASE form. Safe to apply
  everywhere a speaker label is produced or compared. Rank titles are
  dropped ("Dr. Millman" -> "MILLMAN"); gender-marking titles are PRESERVED
  and normalized ("Mr. Smith" -> "MISTER SMITH", "Mme Tellier" -> "MADAME
  TELLIER"), because they are often the only thing telling two characters
  apart -- see _RANK_TITLES / _GENDERED_TITLES.

  Tier 1b (roster_key / remember_in_roster / resolve_against_roster):
  roster-AWARE spelling resolution, kept strictly separate from canonicalize()
  so the latter stays pure. It unifies two spellings ONLY when they are equal
  after removing every boundary mark -- whitespace, hyphens, apostrophes --
  ("ABBEMARIGNAN" -> "ABBE MARIGNAN", "OBRIEN" -> "O'BRIEN"), keeping the
  more-punctuated form. Exact key equality, never fuzzy similarity, so names
  that merely look alike are never merged.

  Tier 2 (suggest_aliases): advisory-only fuzzy matching across an already-
  canonicalized roster. It NEVER merges or mutates the roster; it only
  returns suggestion records for a human (via the Voices UI) to accept or
  reject. JON/JOHN and ELLA/BELLA are deliberately treated as *distinct*
  people in the roster even though they are similar strings -- this module
  will surface a suggestion for a human to review, but will not merge them.

  Tier 3 (attest_label / attest_speaker): advisory local-window attestation
  -- flags labels whose core name tokens don't appear near the label's own
  entries in the source, catching drift/invention the LLM produces (e.g.
  transposed letters, invented names). A MULTI-token label must occur as a
  PHRASE, not merely as tokens scattered through the window, or a name
  recombined from two real characters' name parts attests. READ-ONLY /
  advisory: never mutates
  anything. attest_label() returns the boolean detail record the Voices UI
  badge consumes; attest_speaker() returns the three-way ATTESTED /
  UNATTESTED / UNVERIFIABLE verdict a would-be *gate* needs, because a
  caller that rejects labels must distinguish "refuted" from "our check does
  not apply here".

  Tier 3b (repair_speaker): the ONE place in this module that rewrites a
  speaker name. It fires only on a label Tier 3 already ruled UNATTESTED, and
  only when the book's own text refutes that spelling outright and points at
  exactly one established alternative. It is a policy argument, NOT a proof of
  immunity to the fuzzy-merge ban -- read its docstring, including its list of
  accepted limitations, before touching it. Roster-aware, and therefore takes
  the roster as an explicit argument, exactly like Tier 1b.

EVERY CHARACTER TEST IN THIS MODULE IS UNICODE, NOT ASCII, AND MUST STAY THAT
WAY. The pipeline processes non-English books (French honorifics are listed
below; span_tokenizer.PAIRED_QUOTES carries German, Russian and CJK quote
conventions), and an ASCII character class silently DELETES non-Latin text
rather than failing. Three ASCII classes lived here, each failing differently,
and all three are now category predicates (_is_name_char and the helpers built
on it -- _strip_disallowed, _strip_boundary_marks, _scan_tokens):

  * canonicalize()'s punctuation strip erased non-Latin names to "", and
    resolve_span_labels only accepts a truthy canonical form -- so EVERY
    dialogue line in a Cyrillic/Hebrew/Arabic/Greek/CJK book was narrated and
    the book got no character voices at all.
  * the roster key dropped non-Latin letters, so every such name would have
    keyed to "" -- one roster entry and one voice for an entire cast,
    irreversibly. Widening the canonical form WITHOUT widening the key turns
    "no voices" into "one voice for everybody", which is strictly worse; see
    the note at _strip_boundary_marks.
  * the attestation tokenizer extracted zero core tokens, so the Voices UI's
    attestation badge was wrong for every speaker in every non-Latin book.

Predicates, not regex classes: `re` cannot express "any Unicode mark" without
the third-party `regex` module, and the spacing combining marks that carry
vowels in Indic scripts are category Mc, which `\w` does not match -- "सीता"
came out as two bare consonants under a `\w`-based class.

IMPORTANT: canonicalization applies to speaker LABELS only. Audiobook body
text must remain byte-for-byte verbatim; nothing in this module should ever
be applied to spoken/narrated text.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Tier 1: canonicalize()
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Leading titles are handled in TWO classes, because they carry two very
# different amounts of information about WHO is speaking.
#
# INCLUSION CRITERION (both classes): treat a word as a title only when its
# spelling varies between mentions of the same person -- "Dr." / "Doctor",
# "Capt." / "Captain", "Mme" / "Madame" -- which is exactly the drift that
# fragments a roster. Never list a word that can be part of the name itself.
#
# "ST" is deliberately absent under that criterion: it is a name constituent,
# not a title (St. Clair, St. John, St. Laurent), and saint-derived surnames
# are common in the French literature this pipeline processes. While it was
# listed, "ST JOHN RIVERS" canonicalized to "JOHN RIVERS" -- a different
# character.
#
# CLASS 1 -- RANK titles are DROPPED. Rank says nothing about identity that the
# surname doesn't already say, and the same person is freely "Dr. Millman",
# "Doctor Millman" and "Millman" within one book. Dropping them merges those
# three mentions into one voice, which is the desired outcome.
_RANK_TITLES = [
    "professor", "captain", "prof", "capt", "col", "rev", "sgt", "dr", "lt",
]

# CLASS 2 -- GENDER-MARKING titles are PRESERVED, normalized to one spelled-out
# form per title. Dropping them was a silent data-loss bug: "Mr. Smith" and
# "Mrs. Smith" both canonicalized to "SMITH", so a husband and wife were merged
# into a single roster entry and a single voice, at annotation time and
# irreversibly -- the Voices UI's alias mechanism can merge two entries but can
# never split one. The title is the ONLY thing distinguishing them, so it has
# to survive canonicalization.
#
# Normalization is language-PRESERVING: "Mme Tellier" and "Madame Tellier"
# unify on MADAME (they are one character), while "Monsieur Dufour" and
# "Madame Dufour" stay apart. Folding French onto English (MME -> MISSUS) would
# be a translation of the author's text into the roster, and the abbreviated
# and spelled-out French forms drift against each other in real books -- on the
# 578-label production roster, MADAME/MME split five characters in two.
#
# Judgment calls, recorded so they are not silently re-litigated:
#   * SIR / LADY / LORD / DAME / MX are gendered, not rank, and are preserved.
#     "Sir John" and "Lady John" are two people.
#   * FR moved here rather than being dropped. It was flagged as a
#     name-constituent risk of the same class as ST (a surname beginning
#     "Fr ..."); preserving it contains that risk -- the worst case is now a
#     harmless "FR" prefix on one roster entry, not a silently different
#     character. FR is NOT folded onto FATHER: "Father Milon" reads as part of
#     the name in this corpus and has never been in the title list.
#   * M -> MONSIEUR only as a standalone leading token (same position and
#     tokenization as every other title), so "M. Marambot" unifies with
#     "Monsieur Marambot". A single-letter initial in that position -- "M.
#     Night" -- is therefore read as a title. Accepted: consistency with the
#     other titles beats a special case, and the failure is a visible wrong
#     prefix rather than two characters merged.
#   * The normalized forms are themselves recognized titles mapping to
#     themselves (MISTER -> MISTER), which is what keeps canonicalize()
#     idempotent once its own output is fed back in.

# letters have already been folded down to their base letters by this point.
#
# UNICODE, not ASCII. This class was `[^A-Za-z0-9'\-\s]` and therefore treated
# every non-Latin letter as stray punctuation, which was a total-loss bug for
# any book not written in a Latin script: "Ирина" canonicalized to "" (every
# character stripped, then the empty-string bail-out at the top of
# canonicalize), and resolve_span_labels only accepts a speaker when
# `canonical` is truthy -- so EVERY dialogue line in a Cyrillic, Hebrew,
# Arabic, Greek or CJK book fell back to NARRATOR and the book got no
# character voices at all. `[^\W_]` is "any word character except
# underscore", i.e. letters and digits in ANY script; it encodes
# word-character-ness, not knowledge of any particular language.
# Implemented as a CATEGORY PREDICATE, not a regex character class, because a
# class cannot express "any Unicode mark" without the third-party `regex`

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Tier 1b: roster-aware spelling resolution
#
# canonicalize() is, and must remain, a PURE function of one string: it is
# roster-free and idempotent, and suggest_aliases() depends on that for
# comparison. Roster awareness therefore lives here, in separate functions
# that take the roster explicitly.
#
# Why this exists: an LLM was observed emitting "ABBEMARIGNAN" one chunk after
# correctly emitting "ABBE MARIGNAN", with the correct spelling right there in
# its context. Ordinary spelling drift. canonicalize() has no space-deleting
# path (correctly -- it must never invent or delete word boundaries), so both
# forms otherwise survive as two roster entries, two voice assignments, and two
# voices for one character.
#
# CONTRACT -- never auto-merge similar names. JON/JOHN and ELLA/BELLA are
# different people and must stay distinct roster entries. The ONLY unification
# permitted is EXACT equality on a derived key: no threshold, no similarity
# score, nothing fuzzy. The key is the canonical form with every
# non-alphanumeric character removed, so two spellings unify iff they have
# identical letters and digits in identical order and differ ONLY in their
# boundary marks -- spaces, hyphens and apostrophes:
#
#     ABBE MARIGNAN / ABBEMARIGNAN      -> ABBEMARIGNAN      (unified)
#     O'BRIEN       / OBRIEN            -> OBRIEN            (unified)
#     JEAN-LUC      / JEAN LUC          -> JEANLUC           (unified)
#     JON / JOHN, ELLA / BELLA          -> different keys    (NOT unified)
#
# One key rather than a whitespace-tier-then-punctuation-tier lookup: the
# two-tier version buys nothing here (a narrower whitespace-only match is
# always also a punctuation match, so precedence never actually differs on
# real data) and costs a second lookup plus a precedence rule to explain.
#
# MEASURED on the real 578-label production roster: the whitespace-only key
# produced 2 collision families, and this wider key produces exactly the same
# 2 -- both of them the known ABBE MARIGNAN pair ("ABBE MARIGNAN" and
# "ABBE MARIGNAN'S NIECE"). Adding punctuation to the key introduced ZERO new
# collisions on real data. test_real_roster_key_introduces_no_new_collisions
# in test_speaker_canon.py pins that property so the key cannot silently widen.
#
# The residual risk this DOES carry: names where a boundary mark is a real
# morpheme boundary rather than a typo -- transliterated Korean/Chinese/
# Japanese short names such as LI NA vs LINA or O KIN vs OKIN would be unified
# even if they are two people. Judged acceptable because the Voices UI's alias
# mechanism is the escape hatch, though an imperfect one: aliasing can merge
# two roster entries, it cannot split one that was wrongly merged here.
#
# SELECTION RULE -- MOST BOUNDARY MARKS WINS; ties go to the incumbent (the
# first spelling seen). Two spellings sharing a key have identical letters and
# digits, so the LONGER string is exactly the one carrying more boundary marks
# -- that is the whole rule, and it is why the comparison below is a length
# comparison. "ABBE MARIGNAN" beats "ABBEMARIGNAN", "O'BRIEN" beats "OBRIEN",
# regardless of arrival order. Rationale: LLMs drop boundary marks far more
# often than they insert them, so the more-punctuated form is the more likely
# original. It picks correctly for both observed collision families.
#
# Equal-length variants are genuine ties -- "JEAN-LUC" vs "JEAN LUC",
# "MARY-ANNE" vs "MARY ANNE" -- where neither form is more likely correct than
# the other. The incumbent keeps the slot: deterministic, and the outcome
# depends only on which spelling the roster met first.
#
# Critically, this rule is ORDER-INDEPENDENT wherever the lengths differ.
# First-seen-wins was not: it made the canonical spelling depend on arrival
# order, so one malformed first sighting would become canonical for the rest
# of the book AND be fed back into the prompt's roster block, and generation
# (chunk order) and review (entry order) could genuinely disagree about who
# was "first".

# non-Latin name collides on. remember_in_roster would then have merged the
# entire cast of a Russian novel into one speaker with one voice, and a wrong
# merge is unsplittable (see the SELECTION RULE note above). Widening
# canonicalize() without widening this key would have turned "no character
# voices" into "one character voice for everybody", which is strictly worse.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Similarity metric: rapidfuzz.fuzz.ratio, which is an Indel/Levenshtein-based
# normalized similarity in the range [0, 100]. Chosen (over Jaro-Winkler)
# because it penalizes inserted/deleted characters roughly in proportion to
# name length, which lines up well with short-name confusions like
# JON/JOHN (single inserted "H") and ELLA/BELLA (single inserted "B") while
# still keeping unrelated names like MARCUS/ELENA far apart.
#
# Threshold: 75 (out of 100). Chosen empirically:
#   - JON vs JOHN     -> ratio ~85.7  (>= 75, suggestion emitted)
#   - ELLA vs BELLA   -> ratio ~88.9  (>= 75, suggestion emitted)
#   - MARCUS vs ELENA -> ratio ~18.2  (< 75, no suggestion)
#
# Direction rule: the SHORTER canonical name is suggested as an alias of the
# LONGER canonical name (ties broken alphabetically, shorter/earlier name
# first). Rationale: honorific/typo/nickname variants are usually shorter
# than or equal in length to the "fuller" form (e.g. JON -> JOHN), so the
# longer string is treated as the more complete / likely-canonical target.
# This is a heuristic default, not a claim about which name is "more
# frequent" in the manuscript -- callers with real frequency counts from the
# roster may want to override this ordering.

# Tier 3: attest_label()
#
# Purely advisory, local-window text attestation. The LLM occasionally
# invents or drifts a speaker name (transposed letters, an outright
# hallucinated name) that is NOT the byte-verbatim text of the book -- since
# labels are metadata, not book text, nothing else in the pipeline checks
# them against the source. This tier gives a human reviewer a signal:
# "this label's name doesn't appear anywhere near its own lines" -- without
# ever touching a speaker value, roster entry, or voice_config.
#
# Deliberately NOT a general search across the whole book: a name appearing
# ANYWHERE in a 300-page novel is a near-useless signal (most names appear
# many times, far from any particular character's own lines). Attestation is
# scoped to windows drawn from the label's OWN entries, which is exactly the
# text this label is describing.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A small, deliberately conservative list of generic connector words that
# never carry identifying information on their own and therefore should not
# be required to appear near a label's lines. Extensible -- add another
# lowercase connector here if a real roster surfaces one, but keep the list
# short: anything that could plausibly BE a surname (e.g. "DE" as part of
# "DE LA CRUZ" combos is still excluded on purpose, mirroring how titles are
# handled) should stay out unless it is purely a function word.

                    AND (for a multi-token label) they appear there adjacent
                    and in order -- see attest_label.
      UNVERIFIABLE  the label yields no core tokens at all (it is only
                    titles/stopwords), or every otherwise-missing token IS
                    present in a window but not at a word boundary. The
                    second case is what unsegmented scripts look like:
                    Chinese, Japanese and Thai do not delimit words with
                    spaces, so a correct name is a substring of a longer run
                    and no amount of whole-word matching will confirm it.
                    It is ALSO what a too-short Latin token looks like
                    ("AL" inside "ALICE"), which is exactly why this is
                    UNVERIFIABLE and not ATTESTED -- it is the honest
                    "cannot tell" answer, and callers must treat it as
                    accept-and-count, never as grounds for rejection.
      UNATTESTED    at least one core token appears nowhere in the windows,
                    in any form. This is the only verdict that constitutes
                    positive evidence the label is wrong.

    ROSTER-NAME PARTIAL ATTESTATION (only when ``roster_index`` is given). A
    label with TWO OR MORE core tokens, at least one of which both (a) appears
    as a whole word in a window and (b) is itself a core token of a name this
    book has already established, is UNVERIFIABLE rather than UNATTESTED.
    Rationale: UNATTESTED is defined as positive evidence that the label is
    WRONG, and a label built around a name the book has established is not
    positively wrong -- "KIT'S FATHER" describes a real person the text names
    obliquely, and the honest answer is "cannot tell", not "refuted". The
    weaker rule "any attested token" was rejected: it is satisfied by any
    common noun the model copied out of the prose, which would gut the gate.
    Requiring a ROSTER token is what keeps it narrow.

    Its cost, stated plainly, and NARROWED but not closed by the adjacency
    rule: a label whose tokens all occur nearby but never adjacently is now
    refuted before this rule is consulted, so the commonest abuse -- a name
    recombined from two established characters' name parts -- no longer reaches
    it. What remains: a label with a token that occurs NOWHERE in the window is
    still rescued to UNVERIFIABLE by one roster token that does, and the roster
    is not itself guaranteed clean, so a junk name accepted earlier lends its
    tokens onward. The failure stays bounded -- such labels are
    ACCEPTED-and-counted rather than silently correct, and prose is never
    involved -- but it is a real widening of the gate on a polluted roster.

    ``roster_index`` is an explicit argument, never module state: this function
    stays a pure function of its inputs, and canonicalize() stays roster-free
    (contract 6). Passing no roster reproduces the previous behaviour exactly.

    Deliberately NOT language detection. No script table, no language
    parameter, no per-language branch: the substring probe is a property of
    the text in front of it, so a book in an unsegmented script degrades to
    UNVERIFIABLE by the same rule that any other ambiguous match does.

    Args:
        label: a (canonical) speaker label, e.g. "MISTER SMITH".
        windows: list of source-text substrings drawn from around this
            label's own entries. Not mutated.

    Returns:
        One of the ATTESTED / UNATTESTED / UNVERIFIABLE string constants.

    Pure function of (label, windows): no I/O, no globals mutated, no roster
    access, and neither argument is modified. Idempotent -- repeated calls on
    equal inputs return equal verdicts.

    Call this ONLY on a label the attestation gate has already ruled
    UNATTESTED. Returns the repaired canonical name, or ``None`` to refuse --
    and refusing is the default: every condition below must hold.

      1. The label is non-empty, is not NARRATOR, and is not itself an
         established roster name (an established name is never refuted).
      2. A roster and a book-wide word index are both available. With neither,
         there is no evidence to repair from, so nothing is repaired.
      3. THE BOOK NEVER SPELLS IT THAT WAY. Every token being repaired must be
         absent, as a whole word, from the WHOLE BOOK -- not merely from the
         label's own window. This is the load-bearing guard and it replaces
         the minimum-token-length floor an earlier design proposed (see WHY NO
         LENGTH FLOOR below).
      4. Candidates are core tokens of names already established in this
         book's roster that also occur as whole words in this label's own
         attestation window AND in the book at large (_repair_candidate_pool).
      5. Exactly ONE candidate lies at Levenshtein distance 1 (_is_distance_one
         -- an exact bounded predicate, never a similarity ratio), AND no
         OTHER roster token anywhere in the book's roster lies at distance 1
         either. Two or more of either kind means the evidence does not pick a
         winner, so it refuses.
      6. Tokens that already attest are kept verbatim, in place, with their
         possessive intact; only refuted tokens are substituted.
      7. The rebuilt name must fully ATTEST against the same windows, or it is
         refused. A repair that still would not pass the gate is not a repair.

    WHAT THESE GUARDS DO NOT COVER -- and who covers it. Every condition above
    is about SPELLING: is this spelling in the book, is exactly one roster name
    one edit away, does that name appear in this window. None of them is
    evidence about who speaks THIS span, and guard 4 is weakest exactly where it
    matters: in a two-character scene both candidates appear in the window, so
    the wrong one satisfies it as easily as the right one. Measured across
    production runs of one book, repairs were POSITIVELY correlated with
    attribution error -- the model misspells names in the same chunks where it
    is unsure who is talking. The caller therefore applies an eighth condition
    this function cannot: generate_script._gate_speaker vetoes the repair when
    contradicts_attribution() finds the attribution tag beside that very line
    naming a different established character, and the label falls back to the
    plain rejection it would have had if repair did not exist. Keep that veto at
    the call site: it needs span adjacency, and this function stays pure.

    WHY NO LENGTH FLOOR. A minimum token length ("only repair tokens of 4+
    characters") is a constant with no general justification: it is only ever
    chosen by measuring collisions on one book's roster, and it neither
    protects a long name (ANDRE/ANDREA are both long) nor is needed by a short
    one the book never spells (KITT). It was replaced by two guards that are
    properties of whatever book is loaded, not of any particular one:
      * condition 3 scales with the book: the shorter and more word-like a
        token is, the likelier the author's own prose contains it, and the
        likelier this guard fires. "TWIN" is refused on any book that uses the
        word "twin"; a 12-letter invented misspelling is refused on any book
        that happens to contain it. Nothing is tuned -- the book decides.
      * condition 5 scales with the cast: ambiguity is measured against the
        ENTIRE roster, not just the tokens visible in this window, so the
        denser a book's name-space is, the more often repair declines. A book
        with ANDREA and ANDRES in the cast repairs neither.
    DEGRADATION ON UNLIKE BOOKS: on a book with a very small vocabulary
    (short texts) guard 3 is weak because absence proves less; on a book whose
    cast names are near-anagrams of ordinary words, repair simply stops firing
    (a lost voice, never wrong prose). On a non-segmenting script (Chinese,
    Japanese, Thai) whole-word evidence is unavailable, so the gate returns
    UNVERIFIABLE and repair is never reached at all.

    ACCEPTED LIMITATIONS (adversarial cases; not papered over):
      * ANDRE -> ANDREA, where ANDRE is a real character who is never named in
        his own window (pronoun-only attribution) but IS named elsewhere in the
        book: PREVENTED by guard 3. If ANDRE is a real character whose name
        appears NOWHERE in the entire book, the repair still fires and is
        wrong. Accepted: the model cannot have read a name the book never
        contains, so such a label is far likelier invention than knowledge --
        but it can come from the model's memory of a famous text, and then this
        is a genuine mis-attribution.
      * MARIA -> MARIE with MARIE polluted into the roster by an earlier bad
        label: PREVENTED by guard 4's book-wide condition whenever the junk
        name is not a whole word of the book (which is how such names get in --
        via UNVERIFIABLE substring-only matches). NOT prevented when the junk
        target happens to be a genuine word of the book.
      * ANDRE with an acute accent -> ANDREA: PREVENTED by guard 3. Accents are
        folded on BOTH sides, so the accented spelling is found in the book's
        own word index and the label is left alone.
      * YUSUF -> YUSUP (transliteration variants): PREVENTED by guard 3 when
        the book uses both spellings. When the book only ever spells YUSUP, the
        repair fires -- and is then correct by construction, since the other
        spelling is the model's own invention.
      * TWIN -> TWINS (plural/singular): PREVENTED by guard 3 on any book that
        uses the singular word anywhere. A book that writes only "twins", never
        "twin", would repair it. Accepted, and bounded: the result is an
        existing roster name, so the cost is one line in the wrong existing
        voice, never a new voice and never altered prose.

    Pure: no I/O, no globals, and neither ``windows``, ``roster_index`` nor
    ``source_words`` is mutated. Deterministic and idempotent -- a repaired
    name attests, so feeding it back returns None (nothing left to repair).

# Tier 3c: attribution-tag agreement
#
# THE DEFECT THIS ANSWERS. Attestation asks "does this NAME occur somewhere
# nearby?". It never asks "is it the name the adjacent attribution tag actually
# gives". Measured on one clean 8,081-entry production artifact: of 1,117
# dialogue spans followed by a machine-checkable name tag, 60 (5.4%) were
# labelled with a DIFFERENT established character than the tag names -- every
# one of them attested, so no existing check saw them.
#
# DETECT, NEVER REWRITE. These functions are read-only and return evidence.
# Relabelling a span from the tag would be a second repair_speaker: nearby
# evidence silently overriding the model. The caller routes a detection into
# the retry path (ask the model again, naming the tag) and, failing that, into
# the degradation report.
#
# ENGLISH-ONLY, BY CONSTRUCTION, AND IT DEGRADES TO SILENCE. Recognizing an
# attribution tag requires recognizing a speech verb, and there is no
# language-neutral way to do that -- so _SPEECH_VERBS below is an English word
# list, in the same acknowledged-limitation class as _RANK_TITLES (English
# titles) and span_tokenizer's quote-mark table. On a French or Japanese book
# NOTHING in the tag pattern matches: no token equals "said"/"asked"/..., so
# attribution_tag_name() returns None for every span, contradicts_attribution()
# returns None for every span, and the caller's counters stay at zero. The
