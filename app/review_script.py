    This is the hard, structural guarantee against text damage: "text" is
    ALWAYS taken from the original entry, never from the LLM's output, so no
    amount of accidental rewording/splitting/merging/attribution-stripping in
    a model response can touch the verbatim script. Only "speaker"
    (canonicalized) and "instruct" are taken from the LLM's corresponding
    entry, matched positionally (same index in `batch` and `corrected`).

    Returns None if `corrected` has a different number of entries than
    `batch`. The reviewer is no longer allowed to split, merge, add, or
    remove entries -- a count mismatch means its response can't be aligned
    positionally, so the caller must treat this as a failed batch (keep the
    original entries) rather than guessing an alignment.

    Returns None ALSO when any slot's echoed "text" does not match the
    original entry's text (whitespace-normalized). Count alone is not
    alignment: a response that duplicates one entry and drops another has
    the right length but shifts every later label one slot left, filing
    correct labels against the wrong entries. Measured on a real review run:
    34 misaligned slots, 13 of them one contiguous off-by-one run inside a
    single batch, silently demoting a whole conversation to NARRATOR. Text
    stayed verbatim (that guarantee is structural), so nothing else could
    detect it -- check_text_loss compares the accepted entries against the
    batch they were built FROM, which is a tautology.

    Whole-batch rejection rather than per-slot skipping: a shift means every
    slot after the drop point is wrong, and the slots whose text happens to
    coincide again are exactly the ones that would silently take a
    neighbour's label. Rejecting only the provably-mismatched slots would
    still apply garbage to the coincidences. A failed batch keeps its
    original labels, which is the safe direction.

    Comparison is whitespace-normalized, not exact: models routinely echo
    the text with a leading/collapsed space (41 correctly-aligned slots in
    that same run, against 7097 exact echoes), and an exact compare would
    reject all of them.
    A missing/blank/non-string "text" is NOT treated as a mismatch -- the
    reviewer is asked for labels only, and a response that omits the echo
    entirely carries no alignment evidence either way; those responses have
    always been accepted positionally and stay accepted.

    Punctuation is replaced with a SPACE (not deleted outright) before the

    (e.g. `he said:--"Sicut` -> `saidsicut`). That fusion happens
    differently depending on whether the text was normalized as one long
    string (whole source) or as separately-normalized, then word-joined,
    entries (per span) -- because entry/span boundaries often fall exactly
    at a quote mark. The mismatch is a false alarm: no characters are
    actually gained or lost, only whether two words end up glued together
    by this normalization. Replacing with a space first means both sides of
    every comparison tokenize identically regardless of where the
    normalization boundary falls, since a punctuation mark that used to
    silently disappear now always leaves a token separator behind.
